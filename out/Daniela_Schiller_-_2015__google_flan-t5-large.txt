**Abstract**: Hippocampus Temporal context The most straightforward example of an abstract “space” supported by the hippocampus that parallels the organization of physical space is the organization

**Results**: Recent evidence has also distinguished specific aspects of neuronal coding for temporal and spatial context within the hippocampus

**Discussion**: spatial representations of real-life remembered experiences in the left anterior hippocampus are consistent with those of previous studies (Poppenk et al.

**Conclusion**: A brief review highlights considerable evidence that supports reconciliation of the memory and spatial views of hippocampal function by adopting the perspective of cognitive maps as originally conceived by Tolman (1948).
