### Abstract

### Introduction
not reported

### Methods
The results also revealed that participants who showed larger hippocampal sequence showed a larger hippocampus. The results also showed that participants with larger hippocampus sequences showed better memory function.

### Results
These results are consistent with a framework that bridges theories of hippocampal neurogenesis.

### Introduction

### Methods
the or for african american asd patients was also significantly higher than for european american and asd control subjects, suggesting that asd is a multifactorial disease.

### Results
abstractthe aim of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between the number of hippocampal lesions and the age of the patient. in the retrospective analysis
, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the age groups, with the mean age of patients being significantly younger than that of the control group ( p  0.001 ).
