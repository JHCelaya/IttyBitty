**Abstract**: abstractthe hippocampus plays a critical role in the order of memory retrieval. recent studies have revealed that hippocampal activity patterns during learning are related to successful retrievals of temporal information in different contexts, suggesting that they might be separable additional representations of spatial information during learning.

**Introduction**: the hippocampus has been identified as a critical memory region in humans. this paper proposes that the hippocampus should be considered as a hub for navigation and memory, and that it is important for the hippocampus to be integrated with other areas of the brain, as well as with the rest of the hippocampus, in order to create a comprehensive map of hippocampal function.

**Results**: the entorhinal cortex ( ec ) has long been considered to be involved in spatial memory. recent studies show that ec neurons are activated in hippocampal cortex during periods of episodic memory ( e.g., running on a treadmill ). in addition, ec cells are represented in space and time as representations of their medial location, for example, in the medial cortex of the eye, or in the hippocampus of the brain. however, it is not yet clear whether these temporal representations of the ec are also consistent with those of the hippocampus. here , i will review the evidence that supports the idea that the hippocampus plays a role in episodic memory, and discuss the implications of these findings.

**Discussion**: the hippocampus is a key structure in spatial memory. we have recently shown that the spatial memory of young children with autism spectrum disorders ( asd ) is impaired when they are placed in the left temporal lobe of the brain, compared to their peers in the right temporal lobe. here , we discuss the implications of these findings.

**Conclusion**: this paper supports the idea that spatial memory can be viewed as a form of spatial network activity. this network is organized within the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory formation and storage. in this paper , we suggest that hippocampal network activity contributes to spatial memory formation, storage, and retrieval.

**Abstract**: Theories of episodic memory emphasize the idea that memories are represented in a specific temporal as well as spatial context. Numerous studies have revealed that the hippocampus plays a critical role in remembering the order of events in specific experiences. The most straightforward example of an abstract “space” supported by the hippocampus is the organization of memories in time.

**Introduction**: One view argues that the hippocampus is critical for memory: our ability to retrieve both specific experiences and general knowledge gained from them. The other sees the hippocampus as the hub of a navigation system, supporting the brain’s capacity to calculate routes for traversing physical space. Consensus between the memory and spatial views has been difficult because of differences in the species and approaches used.

**Results**: In studies on animals, the robust observation of hippocampal place cells has long been used to advance the idea that the neuronal networks in the hippocampus parse spatial context into representations of locations in space. However, recent studies have shown that, consistent with its key role in temporally organized memory, the hippocampus also parses temporally structured experiences. The properties of these “time cells” parallel those of place cells, but in the temporal dimension rather than spatial dimensions.

**Discussion**: Fanselow and Dong, 2010; Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012; Milivojevic and Doeller, 2013; Poppenk et al., 2013). Consistent with these ideas, a recent study revealed representations of the spatial and temporal dimensions of real-life remembered experiences in the left anterior hippocampus.

**Conclusion**: A recent perspective asked whether we can reconcile the memory and spatial views of hippocampal function (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014) Here, our brief review highlights considerable evidence that supports reconciliation of these views by adoption of the perspective of cognitive maps as originally conceived by Tolman (1948) The experiments discussed here support the idea that the hippocampus embodies each of these properties.

**Results**: Recent evidence has also distinguished specific aspects of neuronal coding for temporal and spatial context within the hippocampus

**Discussion**: spatial representations of real-life remembered experiences in the left anterior hippocampus are consistent with those of previous studies (Poppenk et al.

**Conclusion**: A brief review highlights considerable evidence that supports reconciliation of the memory and spatial views of hippocampal function by adopting the perspective of cognitive maps as originally conceived by Tolman (1948).
