## Overview

**Research Question**: What research question or problem does this paper address? State it as a single specific question.Answer in 1-2 specific sentences using ONLY information from the text below. Include numbers, names, and technical terms. Theories of episodic memory emphasize the idea that memories are represented in a specific temporal as well as spatial context.

**Approach**: Use these questions to help students understand the theory of episodic memory. Theories of memory emphasize the idea that memories are represented in a specific temporal as well as spatial context. The hippocampus plays a critical role in remembering the order of events in specific experiences. The most straightforward example of an abstract “space” supported by the hippocampus is the organization of memories in time.

**Main Finding**: Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com. Use the questions to help students understand today's featured news stories. Today's Daily Discussion includes the answer to the question, "What is the single most important finding or conclusion?"

## Background

**Knowledge Gap**: One view argues that the hippocampus is critical for memory: our ability to retrieve both specific experiences and general knowledge gained from them. The other sees the hippocampus as the hub of a navigation system, supporting the brain’s capacity to calculate routes for traversing physical space. Consensus between the memory and spatial views has been difficult because of differences in the species.

**Hypothesis**: One view argues that the hippocampus is critical for memory: our ability to retrieve both specific experiences and general knowledge gained from them. The other sees the hippocampus as the hub of a navigation system, supporting the brain’s capacity to calculate routes for traversing physical space.

**Theoretical Framework**: One view argues that the hippocampus is critical for memory: our ability to retrieve both specific experiences and general knowledge gained from them. The other sees the hippocampus as the hub of a navigation system, supporting the brain’s capacity to calculate routes for traversing physical space.

## Results

**Primary Finding**: Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com. Use the questions to help students with reading comprehension and vocabulary. At the bottom of the page, please share your feedback about our show and tell. Back to the page you came from.

**Statistics**: Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com. Use the Daily Discussion to help students understand today's featured news stories. Today's Daily Discussion includes the answers to the following questions: What are the key statistics? Include: test values, p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals.

**Secondary Findings**: The hippocampus parses temporally structured experiences into representations of moments in time. The properties of these “time cells” parallel those of place cells, but in the temporal dimension rather than spatial dimensions. These observations identify temporal coding by hippocampal neurons as parallel to their coding of space.
