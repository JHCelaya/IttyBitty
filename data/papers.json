      "abstract": "Theories of episodic memory emphasize the idea that memories are represented in a specific temporal as well as spatial context. Numerous studies have revealed that the hippocampus plays a critical role in remembering the order of events in specific experiences. The most straightforward example of an abstract \u201cspace\u201d supported by the hippocampus is the organization of memories in time.",
      "introduction": "One view argues that the hippocampus is critical for memory: our ability to retrieve both specific experiences and general knowledge gained from them. The other sees the hippocampus as the hub of a navigation system, supporting the brain's capacity to calculate routes for traversing physical space. Consensus between the memory and spatial views has been difficult because of differences in the species and approaches used.",
      "results": "In studies on animals, the robust observation of hippocampal place cells has long been used to advance the idea that the neuronal networks in the hippocampus parse spatial context into representations of locations in space. However, recent studies have shown that, consistent with its key role in temporally organized memory, the hippocampus also parses temporally structured experiences.",
      "conclusion": "A recent perspective asked whether we can reconcile the memory and spatial views of hippocampal function (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014) Here, our brief review highlights evidence that supports reconciliation of these views by adoption of the perspective of cognitive maps as originally conceived by Tolman (1948) These recent observations suggest that our understanding of how the hippocampus supports memory and navigation may best be advanced."

Reward-related \ufb01ring was extracted from inter-trial intervals, when no cues were presented. Pre-reward and post-rewards never differed from zero for Intermediate \ufffdakring neurons.",

      "discussion": "VP single-unit activity while rats discriminated danger, uncertainty and safety. Most VP neurons were maximally responsive to danger. Cue-inhibited neuron types (Low and Intermediate) dynamically signaled relative threat. Initial relative threat signaling was precise, with neurons decreasing cue \ufb01ring in proportion to the actual foot shock probability."
